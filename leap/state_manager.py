r"""State manager for centralized, thread-safe and process-safe ProofGraph synchronization.

This module coordinates centralized proof graph state when multiple worker subagents
(e.g., formal provers, decomposers, verifiers) work concurrently on different sub-theorems.
It eliminates racing risks by providing atomic single-step subgoal assignment via DFS
and dual-locking (in-memory reentrant thread locks + OS file locks: fcntl on POSIX,
msvcrt on Windows).

One flag varies. A subagent runs:

  state_manager_bin --root_dir=<problem_root> --action=<action> \
      --node_id=<node_id> ( --code_file=<path> | --reason="<one or two sentences>" )

`submit` takes `--code_file`; every other action takes `--reason`. Never both.
The action *is* the outcome -- there is no second flag naming one -- and which
actions a node accepts is decided by the phase it is in, declared in
`pipeline.PIPELINE`.

`state_manager_bin` below is whatever the install exposes this module as --
an entry-point script, a shell alias, or `python3 state_manager.py`.

Usage:
  # Orchestrator: claim the next available subgoal.
  state_manager_bin --root_dir=/path/to/problem --action=claim_next

  # Prover in phase `formal` or `disprove`: hand over the scaffold. Whether it
  # proved, decomposed or disproved is read off the file and the kernel.
  state_manager_bin --root_dir=/path/to/problem --action=submit \
      --node_id=two_plus_two_eq_four \
      --code_file=nodes/two_plus_two_eq_four/proof_scaffold.lean

  # Anyone, giving up on the current phase rather than submitting.
  state_manager_bin --root_dir=/path/to/problem --action=replan \
      --node_id=two_plus_two_eq_four \
      --reason="The plan's step 3 assumes n is positive, which the statement
                does not give."

  The full recompile used to run on every submission, and on the 111-node tree

  carried no definitions block at all, so the majority of a 3.6h run went to a
  check that was structurally incapable of finding anything. (Absolute timings
  off the shared verifier swing widely between sessions -- the same full
  recompile has measured 76s, 167s and 295s -- so the ratios below are the
  stable numbers, not the seconds.)

  What the check can actually catch is narrower than it looks. A colliding name
  is already caught by the local scaffold, which elaborates the submission
  against the full header (step 1); a colliding subgoal is already caught by
  add_proposed_subgoals. The one failure mode left is a new declaration changing
  how *other* nodes' proofs elaborate, and only the forms in
  _ESCALATING_HEADER_FORMS can do that -- _validate_definitions_block rejects
  the rest outright.

  The smoke tier is deliberately thin, and worth being precise about: its
  assembly carries the same header lines, in the same order, as the local
  scaffold at step 1 -- the only difference is the trailing theorem, root's
  signature under a 'sorry' instead of the submitting node's real proof. So the
  one thing it adds is 'the root statement still elaborates'. That is not
  vacuous (a plain 'def' shadowing a short name the root statement uses will
  fail here and pass step 1), but it does not cover any other node's statement.
  Widening it to every node's signature was measured on rollout_1 at 19% of the
  full recompile against the smoke tier's 0.6%, which is no longer a cheap tier.

  Returns:
