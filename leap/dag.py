    Retiring a decomposition leaves its children behind: unreachable from the
    root, never claimable again, and still occupying their names. `fmf_v1_004`
    ended with 15 of them. They are not harmless bookkeeping -- every
    uniqueness check in the system asks `is this name in nodes?`, so a ghost
    refuses the name to whoever needs it next. That cost the run a rename
    spiral: a reviewer refuted `two_pow_totient_gt` for n=4, the prover came
    back with the corrected `n != 4` statement, and the tool refused it because
    a ghost owned the name and then suggested `_alt`.

    Deleting rather than filtering at each check, because a node that exists
    but does not count is a thing every future reader has to be told about.
    After this, `name in self.nodes` means what it says.

    Three nodes are NOT pruned, and each exclusion is a safety interlock:

    - The root, always, even in a graph with nothing else left.
    - Anything reachable from the root. This covers the shared-child case: a
      lemma proposed by two decompositions, one retired and one live, is still
      reachable through the live one.
    - Anything that did work, meaning it has an AND-node, a proof, or any
      search_metadata other than the scoring keys in `SCORING_METADATA_KEYS`.
      The metadata test is deliberately broad -- a node that was merely claimed
      carries `processing` and `claim_timestamp`, so a node held by a worker
      right now cannot be pruned out from under it, and a node that owns a
      directory on disk keeps the name that directory is filed under. The
      scoring keys are the one exclusion, because nothing about them is
      evidence the node was touched: see `SCORING_METADATA_KEYS`.

    What makes this safe is that `AndNode` carries the statements of what it
    proposed (`subgoal_signatures`), so a retired attempt's history survives
    its children. Without that field this method loses history. With it, the
    only thing lost is a dict entry nothing reads.

      root_id: The graph's root. Never pruned.
