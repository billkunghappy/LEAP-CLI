"""Why `claim_next` had nothing to hand out.

Split out of `state_manager._handle_claim_next`, which answered the question
with one sentence for four different situations:

    No available unclaimed subgoals found to claim.
    Graph is fully dead-ended or proved.

"Dead-ended or proved" is the one distinction the orchestrator most needs, and
that sentence refuses to make it. The two outcomes call for opposite actions --
assemble and report, versus diagnose a stall and keep dispatching -- and an
orchestrator that guesses wrong either declares a half-finished run done or
keeps grinding on a run that is already over. The graph knows the answer; it was
simply never asked.

`assemble` refuses on an unproved subtree, so a wrong guess in the optimistic
direction is caught one step later. A wrong guess in the *pessimistic*
direction is not caught at all -- there is nothing downstream of "keep
dispatching" to notice that the search finished twenty minutes ago.

The classification is text only. Nothing here mutates the graph, and no caller
branches on the result: the orchestrator is the one that has to read it, so the
distinction has to survive as prose.
