"""The actions an agent declares, and the read-only node report.

Two kinds of thing end an agent's turn. `submit` hands over a Lean file, and
what it turns out to be -- proved, decomposed, disproved -- is read off that
file and the kernel; that path lives in `state_manager`. Everything else is a
*declaration*: `planned`, `refute`, `failed`, `replan`, `approved`. There is no
artifact to read them off, so the agent says so, and the only thing it carries
is `--reason`.

One function handles all five. They differ in exactly two places -- retiring an
AND-node on `review --replan`, raising the review threshold on `approved` --
and both are three lines. Splitting them per role, which is what `channels.py`
did, meant an agent that never writes Lean had to learn which of two commands
to run and why.

Nothing here files a document. The proof graph holds certified truth and search
metadata; prose belongs to whoever wrote it. The informal prover writes its own
`scratch/blueprint.md` and `findings.md`, peers read those files where they
were written, and no action copies them into the graph -- that would make
`state_manager` the owner of a document it cannot check and give every reader
two places to look.

Phase validation is not repeated per action. An action is checked against
whatever phase the node is actually in, so `--action=approved` on a node in
`informal` is refused because `informal` does not offer it -- not because this
module knows `approved` belongs to the reviewer. One rule, in `pipeline`.

Kept out of `state_manager.py` on purpose: adding a role should cost a row in
`pipeline.PIPELINE`, not a diff to the proof-submission path every other role
depends on.
