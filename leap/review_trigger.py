"""When a `blocked` node gets pulled back for review.

A decomposition is normally reviewed exactly once, the moment it is proposed.
That review judges shape -- do the children close the target, is any of them a
restatement of an ancestor -- with no evidence of how the plan actually plays
out. This module is the second entrance: a branch whose nodes are each being
re-planned over and over without anything closing is a branch worth a second
opinion, and the cheapest place to get one is from the ancestor that could
stop needing it.

Firing the predicate reviews; it does not retire. Nothing here ends a node's
work. The two things that do are the planner calling its own goal dead and an
ancestor's reviewer returning `replan`, and this module exists to put that
ancestor in front of a reviewer while the question is still worth asking.

The trigger is a re-planning rate, not depth and not time. Depth measured the
wrong thing: a node stuck proposing decompositions that get retired collapses
its own live subtree back to one generation every time one dies, so its
ancestors' depth reading never moves and nothing ever wakes them. Time is not
usable at all -- the graph is persisted JSON that gets resumed and replayed, and
a wall-clock stamp would make the same run replay differently.
`informal_dispatches` is graph state, replays identically, and climbs even when
the agent below dies without recording anything.

Kept out of `dag.py` deliberately -- this is search policy, not graph structure,
and it reads nothing but public attributes.

  The mean counts descendants that are already proved, and they are the decay --
  a branch that has closed forty lemmas should not be pulled back over the
  forty-first, and the arithmetic that says so is the forty sitting in the
  divisor. Counting only the unproved remainder instead measures how hard the

  """How badly the worst child of this node's live decomposition is going.

  The maximum over the children, not a mean over the whole subtree. The mean was
  the original design and it had one failure that mattered: a split into four
  children, one of them hopeless and three of them finishing normally, reads as
  a healthy branch. The three healthy children pay for the fourth, the reading
  never reaches the floor, and the one node that could retire the hopeless child
  is never asked. A maximum judges a plan by the worst thing in it, which is the
  thing a reviewer would actually be ruling on.

  It still falls off with height, which is what keeps the scheduler's top-down
  walk from stopping at the root every time. The parent of a stalled node reads
  that node's own count; its grandparent reads a mean over a branch containing
  the stall plus everything healthy beside it. So the walk lands near a local
  stall, and only a plan failing everywhere is still high at the root -- and
  when a parent is reviewed and keeps the child anyway, the child keeps
  climbing, the grandparent's mean climbs behind it, and the review escalates
  on its own.

  Children that are already proved are skipped. A child proved on its 25th
  attempt would otherwise keep reporting 25 forever and keep pulling its parent
  back over finished work. Proved-ness has to come from the resolver and not
  from `formal_theorem is not None`: that field is a DIRECT proof only, and a
  child closed by its own decomposition carries a sketch and no theorem. On the
  run archive, testing the field alone called 301 of 1136 proved nodes live.

  Follows only `active_and_node`, so a retired decomposition's children stop
  counting the moment it is retired -- which is what makes a `replan` actually
  relieve the pressure on the ancestors instead of leaving it banked.

  Args:
    graph: A `dag.ProofGraph`.
    node_id: The node to measure. An id with no node, and a node with no live
      decomposition, both read 0.0 -- a leaf has written no plan, so there is
      nothing to hold it to and nothing for a reviewer to rule on.
    memo: Optional cache of per-child rates, safe to reuse across a whole DFS
      scan.
    statuses: The caller's node-id to status map. `claim_next` already holds one
      from `propagate_failures()`, and passing it is not just cheaper than
      resolving once per node -- that call retires AND-nodes with dead children
      as a side effect, so a second, independent resolve would rule on a graph
      the surrounding walk does not believe in. Resolved here if omitted.

  constant here and no need for one.

  Multiplied rather than incremented. A fixed increment only backs anything off
  if it is large next to the reading, and these readings are unbounded -- a node
  sent to a planner 78 times reads 78. On the run archive an increment of 2 put
  the same node in front of a reviewer between 30 and 285 times in a row, the
  bar crawling up 2 at a time behind a reading it could not catch; doubling ends
  the same sequence in 5 to 7 reviews. A multiplier also holds its meaning as
  the readings grow, which an increment calibrated against a 0-2 scale did not.

  It dies with the plan it approved. The mark is on the AND-node, so a
  reviewer's `replan` takes it out of the graph along with the decomposition
  it was a judgement about. The replacement plan starts at the floor: nothing
  is remembered about an epoch that has been excised.

  It ratchets down within the plan, in `should_review`. A node approved while a
  child was burning twenty re-plans is quiet until 40 -- but if that child is
  retired and the reading collapses to 1.5, the mark collapses with it and the
  bar is back at the floor. The bar is never more than the backoff times the
  worst this plan has looked, which is a reading, so it cannot outrun one.

  A mark of 0.0 -- what the commit-gate review stores, since no child has run

  approved plan gets the full floor allowance.
