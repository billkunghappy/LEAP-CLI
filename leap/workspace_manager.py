    return f"""# LEMMA Filesystem Workspace Architecture

Problem Root: `{self.root_dir}`

Two owners, and the boundary is absolute. Anything under **Tool-owned** is
written by `state_manager` / `WorkspaceManager`: read it, never edit it, and
expect it to be replaced without warning. Anything under **Yours** is yours to
create, edit and delete.

## 1. Centralized State (tool-owned)
- `{self.root_dir}/proof_graph.json`
  - Dual-locked (thread + fcntl OS lock) centralized proof DAG state. Holds
    certified truth and search metadata only -- no prose, no plans, no findings.
  - Managed exclusively by `ProofGraphStateManager`. Never hand-edit it; a
    concurrent write will be lost or will corrupt the run.

## 2. Per-Node Workspaces: `{self.nodes_dir}/<node_id>/`

### Tool-owned
- `proof_scaffold.lean` / `disproof_scaffold.lean` — ready-to-compile Lean 4
  scaffold with the target as `:= by sorry`. Regenerated from a clean baseline
  every time the node is claimed. This is the file you fill in and the file
  `--action=submit` reads; do not rename it.
- `context.md` — your briefing. Regenerated on every claim.
- `*_old_<unix_ms>.*` — the previous turn's copy of everything the tool
  rotates: the scaffold, the briefing, and your role's own log, notes and
  audit under `scratch/`. Moved aside rather than overwritten when the node
  was re-claimed, so an earlier attempt's Lean and an earlier reviewer's
  verdicts are both still here. This is where the record of what has already
  been tried on this node lives. Read-only.
- `failure_report.md` — the full compiler output of every submission the
  **verifier rejected** on this node, newest last. Only exists if that has
  happened; a node given up on some other way has none.
- `logs/<unix_ts>_<type>.log` — one file per recorded attempt, holding the
  message the tool sent back. `<type>` is `rejection` (a submission refused),
  `note` (an agent's own stated reason for the action it took), `infra`,
  `disproof` or `unreachable_abort`.
- `logs/verification/<stamp>_{{local,global}}.lean` and the sibling `.json` —
  exactly what was sent to Lean and exactly what came back, for both compiles
  of every submission. Read these when a rejection looks like it might be the
  tool assembling something wrong rather than your proof being wrong.

### Yours
- `findings.md` — facts you established that outlive your turn. Peers and your
  parent read this at `nodes/<your_id>/findings.md`, so write it for them.
- `scratch/blueprint.md` — the plan of record for this node. Section 8 of every
  briefing under this node points here. The informal prover writes it; later
  phases follow it or send the node back with `--action=replan`.
- `scratch/` — everything else you need: draft proofs, probe scripts, verifier
  inputs. Name them what you like.
- **Never write outside your own node directory**, and never to `/tmp` or
  `/var/tmp`. You may *read* any peer's directory.

## 3. Final Assembled Output (tool-owned)
- `{self.assembled_dir}/final_proof.lean`
  - Unified zero-sorry Lean 4 proof file, generated deterministically by
    `--action=assemble` once the root is proved.
