"""How one proof-graph node is drawn.

Split out of `state_manager._generate_dot`, which had grown a fifteen-branch
if/elif over two colour dictionaries. The split is not cosmetic: what a node is
*doing* is now the phase, and the phase lives in `search_metadata`, so the
drawing has to read the same field the scheduler dispatches on. Keeping that
reading here means the picture and the pipeline table can be checked against
each other in one place.

Two things the old drawing got wrong, both fixed here:

  * **Phase was invisible.** A node waiting for an informal plan and a node
    waiting for a reviewer were both `formal_statement`, both lightgray, and
    both indistinguishable from each other in a live run -- so the picture
    could not answer the one question anyone opens it to ask, which is where
    the work is.

  * **A disproof was drawn as a crash.** `_record_disproof` sets
    `decomposition_failed` on its way out, because nothing under a refuted
    proposition can be worked again. The drawing read that marker and painted
    failure red over the single most valuable outcome a run can produce. The
    `disproved` marker written alongside it is checked first.
