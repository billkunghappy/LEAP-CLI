# LEAP Architecture Specification

This document provides the high-level workflow, agent team specifications, and centralized state/workspace management architecture for the LEAP Formal Proof Pipeline.

---

## 1. Overall Pipeline

The pipeline is a **per-node phase machine** driven by an asynchronous Depth-First Search over a proof DAG, coordinated by a centralized, dual-locked state manager.

Every node in the graph sits in exactly one *phase*. The phase — and nothing else — decides which subagent is dispatched against it, which scaffold (if any) it is handed, which sections its briefing renders, and which `--action` values the recorder will accept from it. All four are read back off one value (`pipeline.PIPELINE`), so they cannot disagree.

### Orchestrator Loop

### The Per-Node Phase Machine

```mermaid
graph TD
    New((New node)) --> informal

    informal["<b>informal</b><br/>lemma_informal_prover<br/><i>no scaffold</i>"]
    formal["<b>formal</b><br/>lemma_proof_worker<br/><i>proof_scaffold.lean</i>"]
    disprove["<b>disprove</b><br/>lemma_proof_worker<br/><i>disproof_scaffold.lean</i>"]
    review["<b>review</b><br/>lemma_decomposition_reviewer<br/><i>no scaffold</i>"]
    blocked["<b>blocked</b><br/><i>no role — never dispatched</i>"]
    Out((Out of the machine<br/>phase = null))

    informal -- "action: planned" --> formal
    informal -- "action: refute" --> disprove
    informal -- "action: failed" --> informal

    formal -- "action: replan" --> informal
    formal -- "result: proved" --> Out
    formal -- "result: decomposed" --> review

    disprove -- "action: replan" --> informal
    disprove -- "result: disproved" --> Out

    review -- "action: approved" --> blocked
    review -- "action: replan" --> informal

    blocked -- "predicate: children_done" --> Out
    blocked -- "predicate: children_failed" --> informal
    blocked -- "predicate: subtree_stalled" --> review
```

Three kinds of edge move a node, and they are three separate fields on `pipeline.Phase` because they have three different authorities. They are deliberately not merged into one dict: `actions` is rendered verbatim into the briefing as the agent's vocabulary, and advertising `decomposed` or `children_done` to a model that cannot cause either is how an agent invents a command.

| Edge kind | Who causes it | Where it is applied |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `actions` | The agent said so, via `--action=<name> --reason="…"`. | `actions.declare` → `pipeline.apply_action` |
| `results` | The submitted file and the Lean kernel said so — never the agent. | `state_manager.record_lean` → `pipeline.apply_result` |
| `predicates` | Arithmetic on the graph said so; no agent is involved. | `claim_next_subgoal`'s DFS walk → `pipeline.apply_predicate_edge` |

The full table (`pipeline.PIPELINE`):

| Phase      | `role`                         | `scaffold` | Briefing sections  | `actions`             | `results`             | `predicates`                  |

`validate_pipeline()` runs at import: every edge target must name a real phase, a phase with a scaffold must be submittable and one without must not be, and `_AGENT_ACTIONS` must equal the union of every phase's `actions`.

### Operational Lifecycle

1.  **Initialization**: `orchestrator_lemma` initializes `proof_graph.json` with
    the problem preamble and root theorem via `init_graph --root_id=<id>
    --statement="…"`, then confirms the layout contract with
    `describe_workspace`. `init_graph` refuses to overwrite a non-empty state
    file. It also refuses a statement it cannot build a sound tree from —
    `graph_init_guard` runs three admission checks before anything is written,
    because every one of these failures is silent at init and expensive hours
    later:
    -   **`check_preamble`** — the statement is split at the root theorem, and
        everything before it becomes the immutable header every scaffold
        renders. An orchestrator that passes only the theorem text instead of
        the whole benchmark file produces an *empty* preamble; the tree then
        proves a statement that is not the benchmark's, and the first symptom is
        an unknown-identifier error several generations down. A preamble with no
        `import` line did not come from a file.
    -   **`check_root_gate`** — the scaffold issued to a node and the extractor
        that validates submissions against it must be inverses. When they are
        not, the node is unsubmittable by construction: no text an agent can
        produce passes the gate, and the rejection tells it to copy a signature
        it already copied. One problem burned ~2h and 215 rejections this way.
    -   **`check_root_compiles`** — a scaffold whose proof is `by sorry` must
        compile. This is the only check here that is not an approximation,
        because the oracle is Lean rather than a regex, and it subsumes the
        textual guards above.
2.  **Atomic Claiming**: the orchestrator claims work via `claim_next`, which
    walks the DAG depth-first inside a single exclusive lock. The walk both
    *finds* the node and *applies the predicate edges* it passes — a `blocked`
    node whose children all finished leaves the machine right there, one whose
    decompositions have all failed goes back to `informal`, and one whose
    subtree is being re-planned without closing anything is pulled into
    `review`. Claims never expire; a crashed worker's node is freed only by
    `--action=release`. Up to 8 workers run concurrently.
3.  **Planning**: `lemma_informal_prover` writes `scratch/blueprint.md` — a
    fully closed mathematical argument, never Lean — and declares `planned`,
    `refute` (it has a witness that the target is false) or `failed`. `failed`
    is *not* a verdict and does not end the node: it lands back on `informal`
    with the reason attached. The distinction it was being asked to carry — "my
    route is closed" versus "this target is unreachable" — is one the action set
    could not express, so agents used it for the first and the system heard the
    second.
4. **Formalization**: `lemma_proof_worker` fills in one scaffold. **Proving and decomposing are the same submission**: an empty `-- [START_SUBGOALS]` block means the target was closed outright, a non-empty one means it was split. The agent never names its own outcome — `record_lean` derives it from the file and the kernel. Stuck, the worker declares `replan` and the node returns to planning.
5.  **Review**: a fresh decomposition lands in `review`, and the DFS will not
    descend past it — children the reviewer may be about to retire are never
    dispatched. `lemma_decomposition_reviewer` rules on the *shape* of the
    split: `approved` releases the children, `replan` retires the plan and
    returns the goal to the planner. The same reviewer is re-entered later by
    the `subtree_stalled` predicate, which fires on *replanning velocity* rather
    than structural depth: it triggers once the live subtree has been re-planned
    more than `SUBTREE_REVIEW_REPLANS_PER_NODE` (4) times per node without
    closing anything.
6. **Refutation**: a node routed to `disprove` gets a scaffold whose obligation is `theorem <id>_disproof : False`, with the target itself handed over as an axiom. A success is terminal and negative: the node dies with the witness attached and its parent backtracks. On the root, that is a successful run with a negative answer.
7. **Assembly & Audit**: `assemble` topologically merges the proved declarations and writes `assembled/final_proof.lean` — but only if **every** node in the active reachable set under the target is `FORMAL_PROVED`. Otherwise it writes nothing and returns the unproved nodes as a worklist. There is no flag to relax this. On success the orchestrator dispatches `lemma_proof_verifier` for an independent kernel and axiom audit.

**There is no attempt budget and no give-up condition.** Nothing in the DFS
kills a node, and no agent can either. A target is settled in exactly one way:
`refute` routes it to `disprove`, and the kernel derives `False` from it. A hard
subtree is re-planned indefinitely, by design.

## 2. Agent Team Specifications

Each agent is one Markdown file in `agents/`: frontmatter plus the agent's
full operating protocol (directive, invariants and workflow, in one body).
The frontmatter is host-neutral -- `tools` lists *capabilities* (`shell`,
`read`, `write`, `edit`, `list`, `web`, `subagents`, `tasks`), not one CLI's
tool names -- and `leap init <claude|codex|antigravity>` renders it
into the layout and tool names that host reads, appending a short "Host
notes" section on dispatch and shell timeouts. See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the layouts.

The Strict Command Policy in each directive -- which binaries the shell may
invoke -- is the constraint that actually matters; the host tool allow-list is
a second line of defence.

The blocks below summarise each agent's contract. They are a reading aid, not
the file format; the source of truth is `leap/agents/<name>.md`.

### 2.1. `orchestrator_lemma`

```json

    "Decomposed parents resolve automatically when their children finish. Never submit on a parent's behalf; its formal_theorem stays null by design.",
    "The only source of truth for completion is --action=assemble, which refuses and writes nothing while any node under the target is unproved. Never hand-concatenate .lean files.",
    "A claim never expires and the graph records no worker identity. The subagent-to-node mapping exists only in orchestrator_log.md; write it down at dispatch and release on crash.",

Two owners, and the boundary is absolute. Tool-owned files are written by `state_manager` / `WorkspaceManager`: read them, never edit them, and expect them to be replaced without warning. This contract is emitted live by `--action=describe_workspace`, which is the authoritative copy.

#### 3.1.1. The Briefing (`context.md`) Sections

`context.md` is rendered from one template of ten sections; a phase declares which of them it gets. A planner is not shown peer signatures it cannot use, and a reviewer is not shown the diagnostics of a single child it is not judging. Section 6 additionally renders only when there is decomposition history to show.

| § | Section | `informal` | `formal` | `disprove` | `review` |
| :-- | :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Global Problem Specification | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| 2 | Active Target Goal | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 3 | Parent Plan & Upstream Ancestry | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 4 | Dynamic Peer Discovery & Role Guidelines | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| 5 | Prior Attempt Diagnostics & History | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| 6 | Prior Decomposition History & Backtracking Feedback | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| 7 | Established Findings | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| 8 | Plan of Record | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 9 | Subtree Ledger | ✓ | | | ✓ |
| 10 | Reusable Proved Lemmas | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Every briefing also ends with a `## How To Submit` section giving each of the phase's allowed actions as a complete, copy-pasteable `state_manager_bin` command with the paths already filled in. That list is `pipeline.allowed_actions(phase)` — the same tuple `claim_next` returns to the orchestrator as `metadata.allowed_actions` — so the agent, the dispatch prompt and the recorder cannot disagree about the vocabulary.


### 3.2. State Manager API Interaction Matrix

Eighteen actions — six agent, twelve orchestrator — split at the source into
`_AGENT_ACTIONS` and `_ORCHESTRATOR_ACTIONS`. Two import-time assertions keep
the split honest: the dispatch table must cover exactly `_ACTION_NAMES`, and the
union of the pipeline's action edges must equal `_AGENT_ACTIONS`.

Every invocation also takes `--root_dir=<problem_root>` (or `--filepath=<…/proof_graph.json>`) and optional `--json_output`.

**One flag, never two.** `submit` is the only action that carries `--code_file`; every declared action carries `--reason` and no file. The action *is* the outcome — there is no `--success` flag, and `proved` / `decomposed` / `disproved` are derived from the submitted file and the kernel, never named by the agent.

#### Agent actions (`_AGENT_ACTIONS`)

All five declared actions share one handler (`_handle_declare` → `actions.declare`). Which of them a node accepts is a property of its phase, not of the command, so there is nothing to branch on. A `--reason` of fewer than `MIN_REASON_WORDS` (4) words is refused.

Two properties of the submission path are worth naming. **The kernel compile runs unlocked**: `_verify_before_commit` takes a snapshot of the graph, holds no lock while Lean runs, and the commit re-acquires the lock and rejects the write if the node's `revision` moved underneath it. And **every write bumps `revision`** — declarations too, not just submissions — because the orchestrator can `release` a node whose worker is still compiling, and that bump is what makes the stale result lose.

### 3.5. Verifier and Search Tools

Two binaries besides the state manager. Neither touches `proof_graph.json`: the
state manager calls the verifier internally on `submit`, and these are the
hand-driven entry points for the same machinery.

#### `lean_verifier_tool_bin`

Compiles Lean 4 and reports whether the kernel accepted it, plus which axioms
the target depends on. Entry point: `leap/lean_verifier_tool.py`. Two backends:

| Backend  | Selected by                                   | What it does |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------- |
| `kimina` | `LEAN_VERIFIER_URL` (or `LEAN_VERIFIER_BACKEND=kimina`) | `POST {url}/api/check` to a [kimina-lean-server](https://github.com/project-numina/kimina-lean-server); `LEAN_VERIFIER_API_KEY` is sent as `Authorization: Bearer`. |
| `local`  | `LEAN_PROJECT_DIR` (or `LEAN_VERIFIER_BACKEND=local`) | `lake env lean --json <tmpfile>` inside a Lake project that depends on Mathlib. |

| Flag             | Default               | Notes |
| :--------------- | :-------------------- | :---- |
| `--code_file`    | --                    | Path to the `.lean` file to verify. |
| `--code`         | --                    | The Lean source inline, as an alternative to `--code_file`. |
| `--target_name`  | --                    | Theorem to run `#print axioms` against. Without it you get compilation only, not an axiom audit. |
| `--timeout`      | `700`                 | Lean compile budget in seconds. |
| `--verifier_url` | `$LEAN_VERIFIER_URL`  | Override the kimina endpoint. |
| `--json_output`  | `false`               | Emit the structured result below. |

`--json_output` returns `LeanVerifierOutput`:

| Field              | Meaning |
| :----------------- | :------ |
| `is_valid`         | The kernel accepted the code. |
| `error_message`    | Why it did not. |
| `used_axioms`      | Axioms `--target_name` depends on. **This is the field that matters for soundness** -- `sorryAx` here means the proof is a hole. |
| `info_messages`    | Compiler output that is not an error: `exact?` suggestions, `#check` results. |
| `is_infra_failure` | **No verdict was obtained at all** -- transport failure, empty response, timeout, a broken local toolchain. |

> [!IMPORTANT] `is_infra_failure` is not `is_valid=False`. The first means the
> question was never answered; the second means Lean answered no. Treating a
> read timeout as a proof regression is a mistake this field exists to prevent.

#### `lean_search_tool_bin`

Mathlib search, for finding the canonical name of a structure or a lemma
before writing tactics. Entry point: `leap/lean_search_tool.py`.

| Flag               | Default                                   | Notes |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :---- |
| `--query`          | --                                        | Required. Natural language or a Lean signature. |
| `--num_results`    | `5`                                       | |
| `--backend`        | `auto`                                    | `auto` = [leansearch.net](https://leansearch.net), falling back to [Loogle](https://loogle.lean-lang.org) on failure; or `leansearch` / `loogle`. |
| `--endpoint`       | `$LEAN_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`, else `https://leansearch.net/search` | |
| `--subagent_quota` | `$LEAN_SEARCH_SUBAGENT_QUOTA`, else `-1`  | Searches allowed per agent id (`$LEAP_AGENT_ID`, or Antigravity's `$ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID`). Negative is unlimited; `0` forbids searching. |
| `--quota_dir`      | `$TMPDIR/leap_search_quota`               | Where per-agent counts are tracked. |
| `--json_output`    | `false`                                   | |

The quota exists because search is the cheapest thing an agent can do and
therefore the easiest thing for it to do instead of proving.
