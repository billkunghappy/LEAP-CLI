"""The per-node workflow, declared as data.

One node moves through a small state machine: it plans, it formalizes, it may be
reviewed, it may be refuted. Which phase follows which is declared here and
nowhere else, so adding a role or rewiring an edge is a change to a dict literal
rather than a change to `claim_next_subgoal`.

What an agent says is an *action*, and it is the only thing it says. There is no
second flag naming an outcome: `--action=replan` is the whole message. A phase
that hands out a Lean scaffold also offers `--action=submit`, and what the
submission turns out to be is read off the file.

Three kinds of edge, in three fields, because three different things cause them:

  * `actions` -- the agent said so. Rendered into `context.md` verbatim, so a
    prompt never hand-copies the vocabulary.
  * `results` -- the submitted file said so. `formal` submits one scaffold that
    is a proof when its subgoal block is empty and a decomposition when it is
    not, and the agent classifies neither. Never shown to an agent.
  * `predicates` -- graph state said so, with no agent involved. A `blocked`
    parent returns to planning because every decomposition of it died.

They cannot share a dict. `blocked` has no role, so nothing exists to *declare*
`children_done`; and `allowed_actions` -- which tells an agent what it may run
-- would otherwise advertise scheduler vocabulary to a model.

Only `informal` can end a node's life. Every other phase that gets stuck says
`replan`, which hands the node back to the planner with a reason; the planner is
the one role that sees the accumulated history, so it is the one role trusted to
call a node dead. There is no attempt budget anywhere: a hard problem is
supposed to keep running.

This module is a leaf: it imports nothing from `dag`, `state_manager` or
`workspace_manager`, so it is importable from anywhere without a cycle and
testable without a model.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tunable parameters
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: How much re-planning the WORST child of a `blocked` node's live
#: decomposition may absorb before the node is pulled back for review. Each
#: child contributes the larger of its own `informal_dispatches` and the mean
#: over its live branch; the node's reading is the maximum of those, skipping
#: children that are already proved. Follows only `active_and_node`, so a
#: retired branch stops counting the moment it is retired.
#:
#: A decomposition is only ever reviewed once, immediately after it is proposed,
#: when the reviewer can judge the shape but has no evidence of how it plays
#: out. This is the second entrance: a plan with a child that has been re-planned
#: four times over without closing is a plan whose author was guessing.
#:
#: Two choices are load-bearing here.
#:
#: Re-planning turns, not total effort. A node proved on its third Lean attempt
#: was worked three times and re-planned once; counting total dispatches would
#: put a large, healthy, productive branch over the line for being large. A
#: healthy branch sits near 1 -- every node gets planned once -- so anything
#: much above that is rework.
#:
#: The worst child, not the mean over the whole subtree. A mean lets healthy
#: siblings pay for a hopeless one: four children, three finishing and one
#: never closing, averages to something no threshold catches, and the one node
#: that could retire the hopeless child is never asked. Within a child the mean
#: is still what dilutes with height, so the top-down walk lands near a local
#: stall rather than always at the root.
#:
#: Left at 4 deliberately. On the run archive, raising it to 12 bought silence
#: in the seven rollouts with nothing stuck -- at 4 they produce six reviews in
#: total, each of which self-corrects on the next scan -- but it also pushed the
#: first grandparent review out from 37/150/171 accumulated planning attempts on
#: the stalled node to 229/518/never. The escalation up the ancestor chain is
#: the mechanism, not the noise.
SUBTREE_REVIEW_REPLANS_PER_NODE = 4

#: What an approved decomposition's reading must be MULTIPLIED by before the
#: node is pulled back again.
#: Approval is not permanent -- it is a verdict on the tree as it stood -- so the
#: node goes quiet rather than deaf: approved at a reading of 20, it returns at
#: 40. This is also the escalation, since an approved node steps aside and the
#: next review lands somewhere else -- deeper if the stall is local, higher if
#: it has spread, and eventually at the ancestor that can stop needing the
#: branch at all.
#:
#: Multiplicative and not an increment. This was `+2`, calibrated when readings
#: ran 0-2 and an increment of 2 was a doubling. Readings are now unbounded --
#: a node sent to a planner 78 times reads 78 -- and against those an increment
#: of 2 is not a backoff at all: on the run archive it put one node in front of
#: a reviewer between 30 and 285 times in a row, the bar climbing 2 at a time
#: behind a reading it could never catch. Doubling ends the same sequence in 5
#: to 7 reviews, at every floor tested.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT a high-water mark. review_trigger stores the reading the
#: reviewer saw on the AND-node it approved, ratchets it down whenever the
#: subtree reads lower, and takes the bar as that times this factor -- so the
#: bar comes down when the subtree does, and a `replan` takes it out of the
#: graph entirely along with the plan it was a verdict on. A mark that only
#: ratcheted up would keep a number earned by a child that has since been
#: retired, and a branch that ran long enough would end up permanently unable to
#: reach its own threshold -- which would silently remove the only mechanism by
#: which an ancestor ever abandons it. There is no ceiling constant because the
#: bar cannot exceed this factor times what is true today.
#:
#: Graph state and not a timer, for the reason the old comment gave: the graph
#: is persisted JSON that gets resumed and replayed, and a wall-clock stamp
#: would make the same run replay differently. `informal_dispatches` is
#: persisted graph state and replays identically; a subtree nobody has
#: re-planned has nothing new for a reviewer to look at.
