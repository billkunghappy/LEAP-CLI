"""Guards on the content `init_graph` is asked to seed a proof graph from.

`init_graph` splits its `--statement` at the root theorem: everything before
becomes `environment.shared_definitions`, which is the immutable header every
scaffold in the tree renders and every submission compiles against.

The split itself cannot fail. An orchestrator that passes only the theorem
text -- rather than the whole benchmark file -- produces an empty preamble,
and every downstream consequence of that is silent: the header renders as an
empty `-- [START_IMMUTABLE_CONTEXT]` pair, the benchmark's own definitions are
absent so provers redeclare them in `-- [START_DEFINITIONS]` (where the
collision gate cannot see them, because there is nothing to collide with), and
the tree proves a statement that is not the one the benchmark asked for. The
first visible symptom is an unknown-identifier error hours later, in a node
several generations down.

So it is checked here instead, once, at the only moment the fix is cheap.
